  <h1>Optical Illusion Interactive Game "The Grove" - Unreal Engine Project</h1>
  <p>
    The shape of the bridges are a penrose triangle that shouldn't physically
    make sense. A lot of time was spent on the lighting and modelling as it was
    hard to keep consistent when the 3D geometry did not make logical sense
    outside of on orthographic perspective. I designed the exterior environments
    for the project i worked alongside with Cayenne Lau and Stephen Tang
