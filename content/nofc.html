  <h1>Non-Fiction Anim Project</h1>
  <p>
    This was a short film I made for a university project, and I used Substance
    Designer to create the inked look. I rendered out passes and played around
    with the depth info in Substance Designer to build up those layered ink
    effects. I also animated some of the parameters in the Substance Graph using
    $TIME to add a bit of weird, wobbly distortion to the visuals. Then, I ran
    all the different passes through Substance Player as sequences, which gave
    me a bunch of unique elements to stack on top of each other for the final
    look. It was a fun way to experiment.
